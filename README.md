# nerdpack-workflow-example

Trying to use my nr1-publish-and-deploy GitHub action with a Nerdpack repo.

## Local Development

Run the following scripts:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Visit https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local and :sparkles:

## Creating new artifacts

If you want to create new artifacts run the following command:

```
nr1 create
```

> Example: `nr1 create --type nerdlet --name my-nerdlet`.
